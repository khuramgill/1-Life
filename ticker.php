</span><span class="text1" ><marquee>Bristol blood donors are being urged to fill available appointments over Easter and into April and May.

Donors are asked to book and stick to their appointments at the city's donor centre on Southmead Road.

NHS Blood and Transplant said stocks are more likely to drop around public holidays, when people take annual leave.

Director of Donor Experience Mark Chambers said continuing to collect blood is "vital".

"We need our incredible donors to step up this Easter, especially if they have the O neg blood group, to make and keep an appointment for the next few weeks or re-schedule if they can't attend," he said.

"Our fantastic teams at our Bristol donor centre will be delighted to welcome you. Every appointment counts this Easter and beyond." </marquee></span>
